## üåü Overview

ICONIC is a community-first event platform designed for network cities like Infinita, where culture, governance, and identity converge. Our mission is to empower people to create and join immersive events with real-time social dynamics, building lasting communities beyond the moment.

ICONIC transforms events into gateways for deeper participation in city life. Users join with a single wallet approval, gain verified access through onchain identity, and connect via dynamic social mechanics like real-time matchmaking. Event creators can issue perks, create gated experiences, and foster long-term communities, all within a system that supports local credits and civic alignment.

We‚Äôre proudly participating in multiple tracks at the Infinita City Hackathon:

üó≥ Governance Infrastructure ‚Äì community-managed event access and reputation

üß¨ Onchain Identity ‚Äì verifiable event participation and social graph

üí∏ Local Economies ‚Äì credit-based engagement, tipping, and perks

üèõ Public Goods & Civic Tech ‚Äì culture as infrastructure

üåÄ Wildcard / Experimental ‚Äì reinventing the social layer of cities

ICONIC isn‚Äôt just an event tool, it‚Äôs the social engine for the networked societies of tomorrow.

## üíº Business Model

ICONIC is built as a multi-sided platform that empowers both event creators and attendees, while reinforcing the culture and economy of network cities.

### For Event Creators:
- **Host with Purpose**: Create interactive, onchain events that generate community, not just attendance  
- **Earn Transparently**: Monetize through ticketing, perks, and membership ‚Äî keeping 90% of the revenue  
- **Build Community**: Retain participants through post-event chats, follow-ups, and recurring gatherings  
- **Manage Access**: Use onchain identity to create gated or tiered experiences for citizens, holders, or members  

### For Attendees:
- **One-Click Entry**: Join events with a single wallet approval  
- **Real Interaction**: Match with other users based on interests, and engage through live dynamics  
- **Stay Connected**: Participate in ongoing conversations and future events within the same space  
- **Earn & Enjoy**: Get rewarded with local credits and perks for attending and engaging  

### Revenue Streams:
1. **Creator Subscriptions**: Monthly plans with access to advanced tools  
2. **Event Fees**: Small cut on ticket sales and credit redemptions  
3. **Membership Layer**: Premium identity features and gated experiences  
4. **Promoted Events**: Sponsored visibility inside the ecosystem  

Our model fuels sustainable community-building, making each event a node in the social infrastructure of cities like Infinita.
